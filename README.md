# DjangoLearning (Note Taking Website)

On this Project I explore how to use Django. The idea of this project is to get familiar with the concepts of apps, MVT (Model, View & Template), CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

How I accompished this task is by making a note taking website. where users can login or create an account. From here, a user can create, edit, update or read their notes.

This plays out as an important foundation for making larger scale websites that need large databases that connect databases with foreign key and public keys. I hope to make larger scale projects with this foundation.
